      <p>
        I began programming in 2020 while studying game development, but I soon discovered that my true passion lay in coding itself rather than game design. 
        Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to web development, with a particular interest in frontend technologies like React.
        Currently, I’m studying to become a frontend developer, emphasizing React, creativity, and writing clean, maintainable code. 
        I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly experiences.
